# AI and Computer Vision Workshop

This repository contains the materials used in the AI and Computer Vision Workshop conducted by Beatriz Emiliano, Raissa Pordeus, and Moisés Cipriano. The workshop covered fundamental concepts of AI and explored the application of Computer Vision for object recognition using the Pipeline library and the YOLO algorithm.

## Workshop Description

In this workshop, we introduced participants to the basic concepts of AI and Computer Vision and guided them through the implementation of an object detection system using hand tracking techniques. The practical activity was conducted in the Google Colab environment using Python.

## Repository Contents

- `hand_tracking`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete source code for the hand tracking practical activity using the Pipeline library and the YOLO algorithm.
- `data`: Folder containing the data used for training the YOLO model. The files are organized in classes corresponding to the detected objects.
- `images`: Images used for testing the hand tracking.
- `README.md`: This README file providing information about the workshop and the repository.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- Familiarity with fundamental concepts of AI and Computer Vision.
- Google Colab account to run the notebook.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Download the `hand_tracking.ipynb` file from this repository.
2. Access [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and log in with your account.
3. Upload the `hand_tracking.ipynb` file to Google Colab.
4. Follow the detailed instructions in the notebook to execute the hand tracking practical activity.

## Additional Resources
